# Onboarding Process for SRE Community Projects

Welcome to the SRE Community Projects! Follow this onboarding guide to submit and maintain your project within our GitHub organization.

## Step 1: Submit a Project Proposal
1. Fork the `projects` repository.
2. Create a new directory under `proposals/` using your project name (e.g., `proposals/my-awesome-project`).
3. Copy the `PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md` file into your directory and fill it out with your project details.
4. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with your completed proposal.
5. Wait for community review and approval.

## Step 2: Project Acceptance & Repository Creation
1. Once approved, the maintainers will create a dedicated repository under the SRE Community GitHub organization.
2. You will be granted the necessary permissions to manage your project.
3. Follow our contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) to set up your repo.

## Step 3: Initial Project Setup
1. Clone your newly created repository.
2. Set up the necessary project structure, including:
    - `README.md` (Project overview and instructions)
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Guidelines for contributors)
    - `LICENSE` (Choose an appropriate open-source license)
    - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Community behavior guidelines)
3. Push your code and ensure the repository is well-documented.

## Step 4: Ongoing Contributions & Community Engagement
1. Engage with contributors by reviewing PRs and providing feedback.
2. Keep your repository updated with clear issues, milestones, and project boards.
3. Actively participate in the SRE Community discussions and share updates.
4. If your project becomes inactive, inform the maintainers for possible archival.
