# SRECommunity Projects

Welcome to the **SRECommunity Projects**! 🚀 This is an open-source initiative where SREs, DevOps engineers, and developers can contribute their projects, tools, and experiments to the community. 
Our goal is to **foster innovation, share knowledge, and collaborate on open-source reliability tools**.

## 📌 What is the SRECommunity Sandbox?
The Sandbox is a **community-driven repository** where anyone can propose and contribute projects related to **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**. Approved projects will be hosted under the **SRECommunity GitHub Organization**.
